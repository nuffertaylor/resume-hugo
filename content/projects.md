#[My Bookshelf](https://www.mybookshelf.dev)
  * Website for creating a virtual bookshelf / database for book spines
#[Google AI Blocker](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/google-ai-results-blocker/cnnlcgcbchhbgagkiaphfoiglddejnbh)
  * Chrome extension that blocks the "Google AI Overview"
#[Book Formatter](https://github.com/nuffertaylor/book_formatter)
  * Given chapters in a txt file, formats them into a printable PDF for DIY printing and binding. Parsing directly from epub files is a work in progress.
#[100 Days of CSS](https://100dayscss.com/progress/nuffertaylor/)
  * A series of 100 different css challenges I completed. Solving all these prompts (or occasionally coming up with my own) taught me the power of CSS.
#[CSSBattle](https://github.com/nuffertaylor/cssbattle)
  * After completing the "100 Days of CSS," I found this fun website which poses a daily CSS challenge in as few characters as possible. The "code golf" aspect of this challenge is fun, although kind of a useless skill.
